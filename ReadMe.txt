# Test1 App

This project is a full-stack application showcasing integration with OpenAI's GPT, express-rate-limit for rate limiting, AJV for JSON schema validation, and various other modern web development practices. It serves as an example of a Node.js and Python-based application structure, optimized for performance, security, and scalability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
- Python (v3.8 or newer recommended)

### Installation
